### Signing up for CLUMSY's Telegram Bot (@clumy_notibot)
1. Ensure backend has been started and Notification service is running.
2. Search `@clumy_notibot` on Telegram.
3. Enter `/start` and follow bot's instructions. 
4. Key in a matriculation number that is available on the frontend pages. 

### Uploading a sign up sheet 
Please use the Excel file `Sign Up Sheet.xlsx` located in `ESDGroup2/frontend/main-app/src/assets` to test out the upload sign up sheet feature in the Attendance UI.

### Clearing Database 
This is only applicable to services that uses `volumes` in `docker` to persist data through restarts. 
1. Ensure that the relevant containers have been deleted. Use `docker-compose down`. 
2. Go to volume tab inside **Docker Desktop** and locate the relevant volumes. Delete those volumes.
3. Additionally, ensure that `restart: always` is set on the service tied with the deleted volume / database. This is to prevent instances where `docker` takes longer to initialize the db and your service is unable to connect to it.

### Notes 
The credentials for the AMQP and Telegram Bot set up is not included in this GitHub repository for security reasons.
